This article talks about the impact that blockchain techronology will have on the billion-dollar pharmaceutical industry. Chronicled, Inc., founded in 2014, has been one of the first to develop a commercial enterprise platform using blockchain technology. The pharmaceutical industry has typically been consernative. This article points out several reasons the industry is ready for blockchain technology. The Drug Supply Chain Security Act requires that when a drug is passed from one party to another, there needs to be a way to record this. There isn't a great solution yet, and blockchain technology can help track the transfer of drugs.
